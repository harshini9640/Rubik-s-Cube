# Rubik's Cube Solver (Assignment Submission)

## âœ… Features Implemented
- Object-Oriented Rubikâ€™s Cube Representation
- Manual Face Rotations with Neighbor Face Updates
- Scramble Generator (random moves)
- Beginnerâ€™s Method Solver (non-optimal but functional)
- Step-by-Step Solving Output with Cube State Displayed

## ðŸ§  How It Works
The `Cube` class models the cube's 6 faces. `rotate()` applies real cube face logic. `scramble()` applies a random sequence of moves, and `solve()` demonstrates a beginner solving method.

## ðŸš€ Run Instructions
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Save the file as `rubiks_solver.js`
3. Run it using:
```bash
node rubiks_solver.js
```

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This implementation is built to match the job assignment spec: not optimized but correct in logic and steps.
